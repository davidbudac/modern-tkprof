# Architecture

`mtkprof` is a modern replacement for Oracle's `tkprof` and Trivadis' TVD$XTAT:
it parses raw SQL trace files (event 10046 / `sql_trace`), builds a
dimensional model of everything in the trace, and renders it as text,
JSON and an interactive web UI.

## Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Core language | Go, pure (no cgo) | Must run on Linux, Windows **and AIX** DB servers as a single static binary, like `tkprof`. Go cross-compiles `aix/ppc64`, `windows/amd64`, `linux/{amd64,arm64}`, `solaris/amd64` from one machine. Rust has no usable AIX target; Java would pin us to the JDK 8 shipped in `$ORACLE_HOME`. |
| Trace format scope | Oracle 19c and later | Older line variants (pre-11.2 cursor numbers, `p1=/p2=/p3=` only waits, old bind blocks) are not a goal. The parser is lenient, so most of them still work, but they are not tested. |
| UI | TypeScript + Vite, embedded into the Go binary (`go:embed`) and into self-contained HTML reports | A DBA can run `mtkprof html trace.trc` on the server, copy one `.html` file to a laptop and explore it offline. `mtkprof serve` gives the same UI live. Trace data never leaves the machine. |
| Data model | Star schema in memory: fact tables (calls, waits, binds, plan lines, transactions, errors) + dimensions (statement, cursor instance, session context, event, object, time) | "Break it down by dimensions and measures" is the whole point. Every fact row carries the ids of its dimensions so any slice is a group-by. |
| Analysis | Done in Go, exported pre-aggregated + raw facts to the UI | Fast for multi-GB traces; the UI stays a thin, responsive explorer. Raw facts are also exportable as CSV/NDJSON for DuckDB, Excel, etc. |

## Pipeline

```
trace file ──► internal/trace (streaming line parser, emits typed records via a Handler)
           ──► internal/model  (Builder: cursors, statements, call hierarchy, wait attribution,
                                 bind sets, plan trees, session context, wall-clock anchoring)
           ──► internal/analyze (resource profiles, per-statement stats, executions, group-bys)
           ──► internal/report  (text report, JSON document for the UI, CSV export)
           ──► web/             (Vite + TS explorer, embedded)
```

### internal/trace — line parser

* Reads with a large buffered reader, line by line, no regexes on the hot path.
* Recognises every 19c line kind: header, `*** ` markers (timestamp, SESSION ID,
  CLIENT ID, SERVICE NAME, MODULE NAME, ACTION NAME, CLIENT DRIVER, CONTAINER ID,
  dump-size / continuation markers), `PARSING IN CURSOR … END OF STMT`,
  `PARSE/EXEC/FETCH/CLOSE`, `WAIT`, `STAT`, `BINDS` (full bind blocks incl.
  `No oacdef`, hex dumps, multi-line values), `XCTEND`, `ERROR`, `PARSE ERROR`,
  `LOB*` calls, `RPC CALL/BINDS/EXEC`.
* Unknown lines are reported with line numbers, never fatal.
* Numbers are parsed from byte slices; event names and SQL ids are interned.

### internal/model — the dimensional model

Facts (slices of structs, referenced by index):

| Fact | Grain | Key measures |
|---|---|---|
| `Call` | one PARSE/EXEC/FETCH/CLOSE/LOB*/RPC/XCTEND line | c, e, p, cr, cu, mis, r, plus self-time (e minus recursive children) |
| `Wait` | one WAIT line | ela, p1..p3, obj#, attributed call |
| `Bind` | one bind value in one BINDS block | position, type, value |
| `PlanLine` | one STAT line | cnt (rows), str (starts), cr, pr, pw, time, cost, size, card |
| `Transaction` | one XCTEND | rlbk, rd_only |
| `Error` | ERROR / PARSE ERROR | err code |

Dimensions: `Statement` (sql_id, hash, text, command type, parsing user, depth),
`Cursor` (one PARSING IN CURSOR instance), `Context` (session id, client id,
service, module, action, client driver, container; a new snapshot whenever a
marker changes it), `Event` (name, wait class, parameter names), `Object`
(obj#), wall-clock time (derived from `tim` and the nearest `*** timestamp`).

Rules that give the model its meaning:

* **Cursor instances**: a cursor number (`#…`) is reused; each `PARSING IN
  CURSOR` opens a new instance. A call for a number with no open instance
  gets an implicit instance bound to an "unknown statement".
* **Recursion hierarchy**: a call line is written when the call *completes*,
  so every call at depth `d+1` that completed since the previous depth-`d`
  call is a child of the next depth-`d` call. Parent resources (`c`, `e`,
  `p`, `cr`, `cu`) include children; the model computes self-time to avoid
  double counting.
* **Wait attribution**: `WAIT #n` lines precede the call line of cursor `n`
  they belong to. Waits whose `tim` is before the call started (think time,
  `SQL*Net message from client`) are flagged as *between calls*.
* **Synthetic statements**: `XCTEND` becomes a COMMIT/ROLLBACK statement,
  LOB calls become one statement per LOB operation kind, so they show up in
  profiles like everything else (tkprof silently drops them).
* **Wall clock**: `tim` is microseconds from an unspecified origin; every
  `*** <timestamp>` marker re-anchors it.
* **Bind redaction**: `RedactBinds` (`redact.go`) is a post-pass over
  `Binds` run by the CLI before any output, so every format agrees. `redact`
  replaces values with `<TYPE len=N h=8-hex SHA-256>` (dumps:
  `<TYPE dump len=N>`; NULLs and metadata kept); `none` empties `Binds` and
  `BindSets` and sets every `Call.BindSet` to `None`. The mode is recorded
  in `Diag.BindMode` (`kept|redacted|none`) and in `Diag.Notes`.

### internal/report — document for the UI

`BuildDocument` emits format 2: dimension tables as JSON objects, fact tables
(calls, waits, bind sets, binds) as typed columns. With `Packed`, every
numeric column of a table is laid out in one little-endian buffer, gzip
compressed and base64 encoded (`blob`); the column descriptors keep
`{t, off, n}`. The browser decodes with `DecompressionStream` and creates
typed-array views, so a 600k-call trace is a 6.5 MB document that loads in a
few seconds. `mtkprof html` inlines the document into the embedded UI page
(`internal/ui`); `mtkprof serve` serves it from `/api/doc` (always with
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` and an OPTIONS reply, so `pnpm dev` can load
`?doc=http://127.0.0.1:8046/api/doc`; it is a local dev server).
Unpacked documents (`mtkprof json` without `-packed`) carry u8 columns as
number arrays, like the other columns. `stats.contexts` is `analyze.Contexts`
(the SESSIONS numbers); the Sessions view uses it and only recomputes from the
fact tables for documents without it. `stats.bucketUs` / the time bucket of
pivot and timeline follow `analyze.BucketForSpan` (UI: `pickBucket`).

`planjson.go` turns each STAT dump (`model.Plan`) into the JSON row array that
`davidbudac/ora-explain-plan-viz` auto-detects (`PlanRows` / `PlanJSON`:
`id, parent_id` (null for the root), `depth, operation, object_name, object_id,
cardinality, bytes, cost, actual_rows, starts, actual_elapsed_time` (µs),
`cr_buffer_gets, physical_reads, physical_writes, sql_id, plan_hash_value`; the
first row also carries `sql_text`, `execution` and `trace_line`). `LatestPlans`
/ `PlansOf` select dumps per statement, and `PlanVizURL` builds the "Open in
plan viz" link (`<base>#gz=` + gzip + base64url of
`{"plans":[{"rawInput":rows}],"viewMode":"hierarchical"}`, refused above
100 000 chars). `mtkprof plan` is the CLI front end (`-list`, `-sql_id`,
`-plan-hash`, `-exec`, `-viz`); `html`/`serve`/`json` take `-plan-viz-url`,
stored as `Document.planViz` for the UI.

### internal/analyze

* Resource profile (Millsap): CPU, each wait event, unaccounted-for, over any
  filter (whole file, one statement, one session, one time window).
* Statement table: tkprof-style call statistics + response-time ranking,
  with recursive children attached (nothing is lost when sorting).
* Executions: EXEC + following FETCHes grouped, with the bind set, rows,
  elapsed, waits — the unit for "why was *this* execution slow".
* Pivot (`pivot.go`): `Pivot(m, FactCalls|FactWaits, by, Filter)` groups the
  call or wait facts by dimensions and accumulates every measure. Dimension
  and measure ids, labels and semantics mirror `web/src/views/Pivot.tsx`;
  `Filter` mirrors the UI's time-window / context / idle filters
  (`web/src/app/store.ts`). Used by `mtkprof pivot`. The same file has
  `TimelineBucket` (bucket size of the timeline, shared with the JSON
  document) and `Contexts` (per session-context stats, as in the UI Sessions
  view, used by the report's SESSIONS section).

#### Findings (`findings.go`)

`Findings(m, Statements(m))` runs fixed rules and returns `[]Finding{Rule,
Title, Severity, Summary, Statement, ImpactUs, Evidence[]}`, most severe
first, then by impact. Evidence rows carry a printable label/value plus
statement / cursor / exec# / call / line ids for linking. Shown in the JSON
document (`stats.findings`), the text report (FINDINGS, after the statement
ranking) and on the UI Overview. Thresholds are named constants:

| Rule | Fires when | Constants |
|---|---|---|
| `outlier-executions` (per statement) | execution (EXEC + its FETCHes) > 3x the median and > 100 ms; needs >= 3 executions | `OutlierFactor`, `OutlierMinUs`, `OutlierMinExecs` |
| `plan-change` (per statement) | > 1 plan hash from STAT dumps or EXEC `plh` (0 ignored) | serious when one plan's avg exec >= 3x another's and the statement took >= 100 ms |
| `hard-parses` | PARSE `mis` per execution > 0.5 for a statement with > 10 executions, or trace-wide with > 10 hard parses | `HardParseRatio`, `HardParseMinExecs`, `HardParseMinTotal` |
| `parse-per-exec` | PARSE calls per execution > 0.9 with > 10 executions | `ParseExecRatio`, `ParseExecMinExecs` |
| `hard-closes` | > 10 CLOSE type=0 of statements parsed >= 3 times whose closes are > 50 % type 0 | `HardCloseShare`, `HardCloseMinParses`, `HardCloseMinCount` |
| `think-time` | idle waits > 30 % of response time | `ThinkTimeShare` |
| `small-fetches` (per statement) | executions with >= 3 fetches at < 20 rows per fetch, together > 100 fetches and > 1000 rows | `SmallFetchRows`, `SmallFetchMinFetchesPerExec`, `SmallFetchMinFetches`, `SmallFetchMinRows` |
| `commit-per-row` | > 10 read-write commits at > 0.5 commits per INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/MERGE execution | `CommitPerDMLRatio`, `CommitMinCount` |
| `round-trips` | > 100 `SQL*Net message to client` at > 0.5 per row of top-level calls | `RoundTripsPerRow`, `RoundTripsMin` |

Severity: time-based rules map their impact against the response time
(trace span, or summed session time when sessions overlap): serious >= 25 %
and >= 1 s, notable >= 5 % and >= 100 ms, else info (`SeriousShare`,
`SeriousMinUs`, `NotableShare`, `NotableMinUs`). `hard-closes` and
`round-trips` are count-based (notable from 1,000, serious from 10,000).
Floors: `commit-per-row` and single-statement `hard-parses` are at least
notable; `plan-change` is notable or serious as above.
